Notepad Extension

This extension serves as a notepad for your browser. Saving will add the note as a list element below the save button. It does not store notes outside of the current tab, therefore notes are unavailable upon refresh or switching tabs. 

This serves as practice utilizing information I have learned through my university and Scrimba courses.
